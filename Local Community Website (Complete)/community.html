        <p>The MRT Putrajaya Line (PYL), also known as MRT 2, is the second Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) line in Klang Valley, Malaysia, and the third fully automated and driverless rail system in the country. It was previously known as the MRT Sungai Buloh–Serdang–Putrajaya Line (SSP Line). The line stretches from Kwasa Damansara to Putrajaya and runs through densely populated areas such as Sri Damansara, Kepong, Batu, Jalan Ipoh, Sentul, Kampung Baru, Jalan Tun Razak, KLCC, Tun Razak Exchange, Kuchai Lama, Seri Kembangan and Cyberjaya.</p>

           <p><br>The Putrajaya Line is the second line of the Klang Valley MRT Project.

            The line serves a corridor with a population of around 2 million people stretching from Kwasa Damansara, a new township development in northwest Kuala Lumpur and its southern suburbs, to Putrajaya, Malaysia’s federal administrative centre.
            
            The 57.7km-long Putrajaya Line, consisting of 44.2km of elevated tracks and 13.5km underground tunnels The line has 36 operational stations, of which 27 are elevated and 9 underground. A further 5 provisional stations have been built along the alignment for future use (Rubber Research Institute (RRI), Bandar Malaysia Utara, Bandar Malaysia Selatan, Taman Teknologi, and Taman Universiti).</br></p>
           
        
           <p><br>There are 10 interchange stations and connecting stations along the alignment, making it much easier for commuters to transfer from the Putrajaya Line to the existing and future rail lines. 17 stations along the alignment are equipped with park and ride facilities, with a total of 6,416 bays available for the convenience of the commuters.

            The Government announced its approval for the implementation of the Putrajaya Line in 2014. A Public Inspection exercise pursuant to Section 84 of the Land Public Transport Act 2010 was then subsequently held from May to August 2015 for members of the public to give their feedback and objections.</br></p>

           <h3><b>Route of MRT Putrajaya Line</b></h3>
           <p>The MRT starts in Kwasa Damansara where it annexed the section from here to Sungai Buloh from the MRT Kajang Line. From Sungai Buloh, the line runs parallel with the KTM Komuter line to Kepong Sentral/Sri Damansara Timur. However, there are a few stations the MRT line between the two which is not served by the KTM.

            The MRT then continues towards the towns of Kepong and Jinjang. As of the first phase, the Putrajaya line ends at Kampung Batu. At Jalan Ipoh, the line starts going underground while Jalan Ipoh itself being the only station on the network to be half-sunken/sub-surface. The line carries under the Ipoh Road to Titiwangsa which will interchange with the LRT Ampang/Sri Petaling, KL Monorail and future MRT Circle lines. The line then runs under the Hospital Kuala Lumpur and meets the connecting station to LRT Kelana Jaya line (also underground) at Ampang Park. Persiaran KLCC serves as a second station in the KLCC subdistrict, itself also served by the LRT Kelana Jaya Line. The line continues to Tun Razak Exchange, interchanging with the Kajang line. The Putrajaya Line reunites with the Ampang/Sri Petaling line at Chan Sow Lin.<br>
            
            <p><br>After thru provisional Bandar Malaysia North and South stations, the MRT Putrajaya line resurfaces at Taman Desa portal, just before Kuchai station. Once again, the line meets with the LRT Sri Petaling line at Sungai Besi, then continuing to serve Serdang. Following this, the line briefly parallels KTM and KLIA Transit (airport express) until Serdang Raya Selatan, and veers off to Universiti Putra Malaysia and the Seri Kembangan subdistrict. The MRT line then enters Sepang constituency, having 3 stops including two in Cyberjaya, before ending at Putrajaya Sentral, where it interchanges with KLIA Transit. The station may be integrated with the proposed Putrajaya Monorail in the future. Putrajaya Sentral will also be the southernmost station under the Rapid KL rail network.</br></p>
